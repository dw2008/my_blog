I’ve been collecting Pokémon cards for over a year now, and like many others in the hobby, I noticed a strange discrepancy early on.
When the set *Prismatic Evolutions* first released early last year, I wanted the Roaring Moon ex Special Illustration Rare. In English, the card was over $150 USD, and I couldn’t ever justify the price. Months later, I took notice of the Japanese version, which was significantly more affordable at less than 25% of the English price tag. When the card arrived, the texture was even more detailed compared to the English one.

It felt like I had discovered a cheat code in the market. I wondered why I could pay so much less for a product that looked better.
I recently did some digging into the economics of the Pokemon TCG and found that the reason behind the price gap isn’t as simple as language differences. A mix of national law, market psychology, and supply-chain decisions influences the price behind these cards. I’ve also found some notable exceptions to the price rule that I’ll cover near the end of my article. Even if you aren't a collector, the way this economy functions is a fascinating case study in how we perceive value.
**Quality Differences**
Before we dive into why Japanese cards are cheaper, let’s first highlight the differences between English and Japanese card quality. *(Disclaimer: I don’t have enough money to own the rest of these cards, so these images are from the internet.)*

<div class="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-4 my-6">
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dw2008/my_blog/main/images/1769972133783-umbreon_eng.jpeg" alt="Umbreon eng" class="w-full rounded-lg" />
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dw2008/my_blog/main/images/1769972147871-umbreon_jp.jpeg" alt="Umbreon jp" class="w-full rounded-lg" />
</div>

Above, we have the English and Japanese variations of the Umbreon ex Special Illustration Rare from *Prismatic Evolutions*. Visually, these two cards already have very different printings. The Japanese Umbreon has much more detail, while the English one has a rougher, fingerprint-like texture. Even so, the raw market prices on these cards differ vastly. According to TCGPlayer.com, a major online trading card sale platform, the English Umbreon sells for $865.00, while the Japanese version sells for a much lower $309.53 (all market prices are of 1/25/2026). 
If we want a more “objective” measure of print quality, we can look at grading data. If you aren't familiar with the technical side of the hobby, most high-value cards are graded. This is a process where a third-party company (like PSA) evaluates a card’s condition and print quality under a microscope and seals it in a protective plastic "slab" with a score from 1 to 10. A grade of 10 is considered a perfect “Gem Mint” card and can sometimes double or triple a card’s value. 
According to PSA’s population report, the English Umbreon ex has only a 31.8% Gem Mint rate, while the Japanese version has a 87.6% Gem Mint rate. This data highlights the printing discrepancies between languages, as the Japanese version’s Gem Mint rate is considerably higher.
This pattern doesn’t just stop at this one card, however. Another example of a popular card is the Pikachu ex Special Illustration Rare from *Surging Sparks*.

<div class="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-4 my-6">
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dw2008/my_blog/main/images/1769974960427-pikachu_eng.jpeg" alt="Pikachu eng" class="w-full rounded-lg" />
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dw2008/my_blog/main/images/1769975033665-pikachu_jp.jpeg" alt="Pikachu jp" class="w-full rounded-lg" />
</div>

Once again, we can see a texture difference. PSA’s population report states that the English version has a 33.5% Gem Mint rate, while the Japanese one has an 89.9% Gem Mint rate. Still, TCGPlayer’s market prices show once again that the English version is much more expensive than the Japanese one (although not to the Umbreon’s extent), with raw market prices of $258.54 and $191.99 respectively. 
If these Japanese cards are cheaper and higher quality, why isn't every collector in the world buying them? The first reason lies in the sheer scale of the English market.
**Global Markets**
According to official data from The Pokémon Company International, the Pokémon TCG is currently available in 76 countries and regions and translated into 13 languages. However, there is a major imbalance in how those languages are distributed.
While Japanese is almost exclusively produced for the domestic market in Japan, English is the bridge language for the rest of the world. It is the primary product for massive markets like, North America (USA and Canada), Oceania (Australia and New Zealand), The United Kingdom, and more.
Furthermore, in many countries where there is no local translation (such as many Northern European nations), the English version is the official product sold in stores. This abundance makes English products (usually) more accessible to more people. For example, in America, someone can walk into a local Target or Walmart and buy an English pack, whereas Japanese cards often require international shipping or specialized hobby shops, which limits their "casual” demand.
**MSRP**
Even if you can go to a retailer to find English packs, the product sitting on that shelf is fundamentally different from what you would find in a Japanese Pokemon Center. The price gap begins long before the cards hit the secondary market, starting with the Manufacturer Suggested Retail Price (MSRP).
When we look at official retail prices from the Pokemon Center, the numbers are staggering.
In Japan, you can purchase a standard booster box of 30 packs for roughly 5,400 yen (~$35 USD). In English, a standard booster box of 36 packs retails for around $161 USD.
At first glance, English already seems like a worse deal, being around four times more expensive than Japanese. One potential saving grace is that English packs have 10 cards each, whereas Japanese packs only have 5. However, as any collector will tell you, the vast majority of those 360 English cards are "bulk" common cards that hold almost no monetary or competitive value. Since the "hits" occupy the same limited slots in a pack regardless of the language, English collectors are essentially paying a 4x premium for filler cards, driving up prices of English “hits” on the secondary market.
**Manufacturing**
This focus on massive volume driven by larger markets and a need for extra “bulk” cards highlights a core of the issue: the manufacturing process itself.
![1769975903071-mpgTrophy.jpeg](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dw2008/my_blog/main/images/1769975903071-mpgTrophy.jpeg)
All English, European, and Latin American cards are handled by Millennium Print Group (MPG), a subsidiary of the Pokemon Company International based in the U.S. and the Netherlands. MPG has the monumental task of printing more cards in dozens of languages for nearly 80 countries, which often leads to poorer quality control (hence the worse grading statistics).
In comparison, the Pokemon Company (not the International one) manages Japanese printing directly. Because they only focus on a few languages (Japanese, Chinese, and Thai), they can maintain a much higher standard of precision. They don't have to sacrifice quality for the sheer quantity required to supply the entire Western world.
**Pull Rates**
This difference in manufacturing philosophy leads directly to the most significant factor in a card's market price: the pull rates. In Western markets, opening a booster box is a game of pure chance. You can rip open dozens of packs and walk away with absolutely nothing but basic holographic cards—a frustrating experience many collectors (myself included) have dealt with firsthand. Because English sets are fully randomized, certain high-end cards can become incredibly scarce, driving their prices into the hundreds or thousands.
In Japan, this experience is much more regulated. Due to strict anti-gambling and consumer protection laws, a standard Japanese booster box typically guarantees specific high-rarity slots. While it varies by set, you are generally guaranteed a certain amount of "hits" per box, supplying the Japanese market with a steady stream of high-rarity cards. 
**Diluted Odds**
To make matters more difficult for Western collectors, English sets can be diluted compared to their Japanese counterparts.
Japanese sets typically release two months ahead of the English versions. When those cards eventually make their way West, the Pokémon Company sometimes combines multiple Japanese sets into one massive English expansion. For example, the English set *Surging Sparks* (the set where the Pikachu ex is from) combined the two separate Japanese sets *Super Electric Breaker* and *Paradise Dragona*.
![1769976092215-ssp_BB.jpg](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dw2008/my_blog/main/images/1769976092215-ssp_BB.jpg)

<div class="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-4 my-6">
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dw2008/my_blog/main/images/1769976276830-superelectricbreaker.jpeg" alt="Super Electric Breaker" class="w-full rounded-lg" />
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dw2008/my_blog/main/images/1769976305602-paradisedragona.jpeg" alt="Paradise Dragona" class="w-full rounded-lg" />
</div>

By mashing sets together, the card pool for the English version becomes much larger. If you are hunting for one specific card in these combined sets, your odds are generally worse in English because you are fighting against a much larger list of possible pulls. This artificial scarcity, combined with the lack of a guarantee per box plus the increased MSRP, is why a card like the English Pikachu ex maintains a price premium over the easier-to-find Japanese version.
**The Rarity of Perfection**
Lastly, I want to circle back to the world of grading, because this is where the price discrepancy truly reaches its peak.
As we’ve already established, Japanese cards have significantly higher PSA 10 Gem Mint rates. When you combine the precision of Japanese printing with the guaranteed hits in every box, you end up with a market where high-quality cards are standard. However, in the world of collectibles, perfection is only expensive if it is rare. Because English cards are so much harder to pull and so much more likely to have factory defects, a perfect English PSA 10 becomes a luxury item for collectors. This creates a massive price gap where the technically "inferior" English card commands a much higher premium simply because a flawless copy is so hard to find.
To illustrate this, we can look at the Mew ex Special Illustration Rare from *Paldean Fates* (affectionately known as the "Bubble Mew"). As of late January 2026, the price difference for a PSA 10 copy (taken from pricecharting.com) is staggering:
The English PSA 10 commands a market price of roughly $1,766.30 USD.
In comparison, the Japanese PSA 10 sits at a much more accessible $569.93 USD.
![1769976677876-bubble_mew.jpeg](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dw2008/my_blog/main/images/1769976677876-bubble_mew.jpeg)
Statistically, the Japanese version is much easier to grade as a 10 (85.4% vs 36.3% Gem Mint rate), meaning there are more perfect copies available for collectors. For the English version, the low Gem Mint rate means that collectors and investors are willing to pay a 300% premium just for the slab to have a 10 on it.
**Notable Exceptions**
While the "Japanese is cheaper" rule holds true for most modern cards, the Pokémon market has several fascinating exceptions where the logic flips. Sometimes, Japanese cards can actually command a massive premium.
**Japanese-Exclusive Promos:** The most obvious exception is when an English version doesn't exist at all. Legendary cards like the Mario & Luigi Pikachu promos were only released in Japan. Without an English alternative to satisfy global demand, these cards become world-wide grails, with prices that reflect their status. According to pricecharting.com, the Luigi Pikachu full art goes for $3,599 USD ungraded and $10,500 USD in a PSA 10, with the Mario Pikachu full art at $5,170 USD ungraded and a staggering $17,500 USD in a PSA 10.

**"Waifu" Culture & Speculation:** In the Japanese market, female Trainer cards experience extreme price hikes that rarely translate to the English market. This is driven by a mix of domestic collecting culture and positive feedback loops. As a card gains hype, speculators buy in, driving the price even higher. In these cases, the Japanese version is usually more expensive than the English one. For example, this Lillie’s Determination card is worth $72.80 USD in English and $149.12 USD in Japanese (TCGPlayer). 
![1769976973828-lillie.jpeg](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dw2008/my_blog/main/images/1769976973828-lillie.jpeg)
**Favorable English Pull Rates:** Occasionally, English sets break the low pull rate rule. For 2023's *Obsidian Flames*, the pull rates were unusually high. Because the market was flooded with "hits" so quickly, the value of the English cards tanked, making them much cheaper than the Japanese counterparts from *Ruler of the Black Flame*. The sets’ Charizard ex Special Illustration Rare goes for $81.65 USD in English and $125.96 USD in Japanese. 
![1769976989877-egawa_charizard.jpeg](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dw2008/my_blog/main/images/1769976989877-egawa_charizard.jpeg)
**Print Runs & Supply:** Sometimes, Japanese supply is actually lower than English. For example, the Lugia V Alternate Art from Paradigm Trigger (JP) vs. Silver Tempest (EN). Even though the Japanese version has a much higher PSA 10 rate (84.1%) compared to the English rate (56.3%), the Japanese card actually sells for more ($423 USD vs $355 USD). This is often due to shorter Japanese print runs for specific sets, creating a supply squeeze that outweighs the global reach of English.

**Conclusion**
At the end of the day, my journey into the world of Japanese cards taught me one important lesson: stretching your hobby dollars is about understanding what you value. If you’re also someone who collects for the love of the art and the beauty of a pristine, high-quality display piece, Japanese cards offer a way to own masterpiece quality without an absurd price tag.
Value is subjective. Whether you prefer the English or Japanese, there is no wrong way to collect.
Thanks for reading! I hope this sheds some light on the strange, shiny world of international Pokémon markets.
