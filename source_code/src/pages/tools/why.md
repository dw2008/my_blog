i would like a modern resume builder dashboard suitable for a college freshman. i would like a two column layout with Forms on the left, Resume Preview on the right showing a live editor. i want four different styles of the resume to choose from, content has to be suitable for a college freshman. the service doesn't have storage, but i dont want the user to have to type in the same information again and again, so i want to have some way to export/import data. find out the proper format of the import/exlook port, then ask me questions if not clear.
