I’ve been collecting Pokémon cards for over a year now, and like many others in the hobby, I noticed a strange discrepancy early on.
When *Prismatic Evolutions* first released early last year, I wanted the Roaring Moon ex Special Illustration Rare. In English, the card was over $150, and I couldn’t ever justify the price. Months later, I took notice of the Japanese version, which was significantly more affordable at less than 25% of the English price tag. When the card arrived, the texture was even more detailed compared to the English one.

It felt like I had discovered a cheat code in the market. I wondered why I could pay so much less for a product that looked better.
I recently did some digging into the economics of the Pokemon TCG and found that the reason behind the price gap isn’t as simple as language differences. A mix of national law, market psychology, and supply-chain decisions influences the price behind these cards. I’ve also found some notable exceptions to the price rule that I’ll cover near the end of my article. Even if you aren't a collector, the way this economy functions is a fascinating case study in how we perceive value.
