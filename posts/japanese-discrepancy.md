I’ve been collecting Pokémon cards for over a year now, and like many others in the hobby, I noticed a strange discrepancy early on.
When the set *Prismatic Evolutions* first released early last year, I wanted the Roaring Moon ex Special Illustration Rare. In English, the card was over $150 USD, and I couldn’t ever justify the price. Months later, I took notice of the Japanese version, which was significantly more affordable at less than 25% of the English price tag. When the card arrived, the texture was even more detailed compared to the English one.

It felt like I had discovered a cheat code in the market. I wondered why I could pay so much less for a product that looked better.
I recently did some digging into the economics of the Pokemon TCG and found that the reason behind the price gap isn’t as simple as language differences. A mix of national law, market psychology, and supply-chain decisions influences the price behind these cards. I’ve also found some notable exceptions to the price rule that I’ll cover near the end of my article. Even if you aren't a collector, the way this economy functions is a fascinating case study in how we perceive value.
**Quality Differences**
Before we dive into why Japanese cards are cheaper, let’s first highlight the differences between English and Japanese card quality. *(Disclaimer: I don’t have enough money to own the rest of these cards, so these images are from the internet.)*

Above, we have the English and Japanese variations of the Umbreon ex Special Illustration Rare from *Prismatic Evolutions*. Visually, these two cards already have very different printings. The Japanese Umbreon has much more detail, while the English one has a rougher, fingerprint-like texture. Even so, the raw market prices on these cards differ vastly. According to TCGPlayer.com, a major online trading card sale platform, the English Umbreon sells for $865.00, while the Japanese version sells for a much lower $309.53 (all market prices are of 1/25/2026). 
If we want a more “objective” measure of print quality, we can look at grading data. If you aren't familiar with the technical side of the hobby, most high-value cards are graded. This is a process where a third-party company (like PSA) evaluates a card’s condition and print quality under a microscope and seals it in a protective plastic "slab" with a score from 1 to 10. A grade of 10 is considered a perfect “Gem Mint” card and can sometimes double or triple a card’s value.
According to PSA’s population report, the English Umbreon ex has only a 31.8% Gem Mint rate, while the Japanese version has a 87.6% Gem Mint rate. This data highlights the printing discrepancies between languages, as the Japanese version’s Gem Mint rate is considerably higher.
This pattern doesn’t just stop at this one card, however. Another example of a popular card is the Pikachu ex Special Illustration Rare from Surging Sparks.
