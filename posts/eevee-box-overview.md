**Introduction**
	Eevee Box is one of the most versatile decks you can play in the current format of the Pokemon TCG, and it’s been my favorite deck to play ever since I picked it up. The deck has so many great attackers to use, ranging from Flareon and Leafeon ex, to even Pidgeot ex in a pinch. This vast array of options allows for adaptation and creative playmaking, making Eevee Box one of the most skill-intensive and fun decks in the game. Because of its flexible nature, the deck allows for specific techs for any prevalent deck, allowing for exceptional meta adaptability. This deck is very much a tempo-focused deck, as we’ll be trying to pull off as many combos as we can in a row using the tools we have.  This is the deck I’ve been almost exclusively playing for half a year, so I’m pretty confident in its lines. If you have any questions about this guide, please feel free to DM me on Discord @tiantianwoo!
**Decklist & Deck Overview**
https://limitlesstcg.com/decks/list/20979
	The primary list I’ve played is Emma Hagen’s Gdansk Regionals top 2 list (I'll include a copyable decklist at the end of this article). I learned a bunch of gameplay knowledge from her Metafy guide, so I would definitely recommend checking out her guides and tournament games. I’ll explain my thoughts on why each card is included and give a brief summary of how they are used in matches. Although it’s slightly outdated for some matchups, the core of the deck is still functioning very well and can perform as needed. This list is the quintessential Eevee Box list, and it’s a great starting point for the deck. This decklist opts for consistency, as we REALLY want to have a Fan Rotom turn 1 and a Tera in play by turn 2 going first. One of the main weaknesses of the deck is being prone to bricking off of turn 1 or a late-game Iono, which this list attempts to address. There’s also a relatively new Dusknoir variant and a future Mega Dragonite variant, but I will likely go over those in future posts. 
**Setup**
	The core of this deck comes from the Hoothoot Noctowl line. It’s arguably the most important cards in our deck, as with a Tera in play, Noctowl’s ability lets us grab two trainer cards (items, supporters, stadium, tools) upon evolving. This ability is incredibly strong, and is the backbone of our setup and the reason why we can afford to play so many one-of cards, as we can search them out with Noctowl. To get our boardstate set up in the first place, it’s very important to open up with Fan Rotom and grab three of our colorless Pokemon with 100 hp or less, like our owls, Pidgey, or Eevee. A general good board state after turn 1 is something like a Fan Rotom, two Hoothoots, a Pidgey, an Eevee, and another Tera, with at most one Noctowl in hand so we have more Noctowls in deck to draw from if they Iono us. 
	Turn 2, we want to set up Pidgeot with Noctowl into Rare Candy + Cyrano/Hilda. Pidgeot is incredibly helpful late game, since our deck relies so heavily on Noctowls. If we can’t draw Noctowls when we need them, we’re pretty screwed late game. However, Pidgeot’s Quick Search mitigates this, as we can play with our deck in our hands when it’s active. Because we rely on Rare Candy to get Pidgeot set up, we’ll probably struggle to set it up if we’re against item lock, or if one of the pieces is prized. Still, Pidgeot ex is a great addition to the deck that we should prioritize setting up. Most of the time, it’s not a very good idea to Crispin turn 2 unless we have many of the Pidgeot pieces in our hand already. Setting up with Cyrano/Hilda is such a necessity with our deck, so using our turn 2 supporter on Crispin can really hurt us if we don’t have a proper boardstate yet. It’s totally okay to commit Crystal turn 2 if it means we’re able to set up and get our momentum going without the use of Crispin.
**Attackers**
	Going into the attacking options, we first have the namesake of the deck, Flareon!! Flareon’s Burning Charge is an incredibly strong attack, as it allows us to take very aggressive knockouts on 1-prizers early on the game, as it means we can set up a backup attacker on the bench while doing so. Going to odd prizes isn’t even all that bad because we have access to Briar, which lets us take an extra prize if the opponent is at 2 prizes and we take a knockout. This means that against hyper-aggressive decks like Gholdengo, we can potentially go a 1-2-3 prize mapping if we can’t do a 2-2-2. Also, Flareon’s second attack is usually going to be our highest-damaging attacking option for most matchups. With Gravity Mountain and Black Belt’s Training, we can hit 310 and 320 damage respectively, meaning that we can one-shot many prevalent threats like Gardevoir and Dragapult. Overall, Flareon is our strongest and most consistent attacker that we can use in pretty much every matchup. 
	For the secondary attackers, we can choose these based on what’s prized or what matchup we’re going in. Another consistent attacking option that we can use very often is Terapagos. We’re usually going to use the turtle for its first attack, which does 30x the amount of benched pokemon (can hit up to 240 with 8 on our bench with Area Zero). This is enough to one-shot many important supports like Fezandipiti and Latias, so it’s a great attack to finish up KOs without needing specific energy requirements (2 colorless). We also have Leafeon, which is especially important for the current dark-types in the meta, like Charizard, Grimmsnarl, Absol, and Zoroark. Leafeon hits for weakness on all of these, so it’s really good for one-shotting. Even outside of these matchups, Leafeon can see good use. Its first attack can punish decks that load tons of energy (like Gardevoir or Kangaskhan), and its second attack can clean up residual damage on the bench, really screwing over Dragapult or Frosslass prize maps. Our last Tera attacking option is Wellspring Ogerpon, and this is probably the one that I’m most shaky about. While its Torrential Pump can potentially boardwipe one-prizers, committing to it at round start is so resource-intensive that it usually cripples us for the rest of the game. Unless it’s absolutely necessary to keep up the prize race or can win on the spot, it’s usually not a great idea. However, using Sob to retreat lock some supports can really help buy time if you somehow need to play from behind (but I find that this barely ever happens). I usually only attack with Ogerpon if I can burning charge to accelerate energy to it first, but it’s still a great card if you can commit to it without overextending. Finally, there’s Bloodmoon Ursaluna. The big bear is a great closer if we can’t get energy on the board in the endgame, but we can also Burning Charge to it mid-game if we really need to. It can also clean up fairly well with our damage modification options, as with Black Belt/Gravity Mountain it can take down many Pokemon that aren’t super beefy. 
	Also, because of our deck’s flexible nature, we can attack using some “nontraditional” attackers. If we need to fix the prize trade somehow and make the opponent waste a turn, we can use Fan Rotom to attack. Also, Pidgeot’s attack, while seemingly weak at first, can get rid of Team Rocket’s Watchtower (which cripples our deck) and also our own Area Zero, enabling us to discard benched liabilities (important against any spread deck). Furthermore, if absolutely necessary, we can power up Fezandipiti fairly easily using Burning Charge or Crispins. 
**Important Lines**
In this section, I’ll cover some important combos that Eevee Box thrives on. These combos aren’t necessarily mutually exclusive and can be combod with each other as well, but I’ll just list them overall.
***Black Belt:*** Black Belt is a very flexible damage amp card, as stated before (although only when attacking ex Pokemon). The most common usage is with Carnelian for 320, but there are some scenarios with others like Blood Moon for 280 and Torrential Pump for 280 on a Ceruledge. 
***Gravity Mountain:*** This is similar to Black Belt as it acts as an effective 30 damage amp on Stage 2s. This is especially useful for Carnelian on Gardevoir/Grimm, and there’s even a cool combo you can do with Fezandipiti onto Gardevoir!! (Cruel Arrow + Black Belt + Gravity Mountain gives 100 + 40 + 30, which hits for weakness and one shots a Gardevoir). You can also bump Area Zero with Gravity Mountain, getting rid of liabilities or Noctowls to recycle later with Night Stretcher.
***Crispin + Crystal:*** Crispin + Crystal enables us to charge up any of our Teras in 1 turn, allowing us to spawn a big attack out of nowhere or keep using Torrential Pumps. Outside of the Wellspring use, this line shouldn’t come up too much if you manage your resources right. 
***Carnelian + Jet Energy:*** Carnelian’s drawback of not being able to attack the following turn can be easily cleansed by switching out Flareon with a Jet Energy attachment to the bench + retreating back to Flareon, chaining Carnelians.
***Night Stretcher + Boosted Evolution Eevee:*** If our opponents manage to knockout one of our Eevees and we need another one immediately (which is sometimes the case for Leafeon lines), we can use the 50 HP Eevee and recycle our Eeveelution using Night Stretcher to make our opponents suffer again.
***Glass Trumpet + Eswitch:*** If we have a Tera in play, we can use Glass Trumpet + Eswitch onto any of our colorless Pokemon to act as a pseudo-Crispin without needing to eat up our supporter for turn. This can be incredibly helpful if we need energy badly but cannot afford a Crispin.
***Briar + Counter Catcher:*** Last but definitely not least, we have the Briar + CC combo. Against aggressive matchups like Gholdengo, this line is incredibly powerful. Because we have access to this, we’re totally fine with taking the first prize and going down to 5 prizes. If they go down to 2 prizes while we’re still at 3 prizes, we can use Briar + CC to gust up a 2-prize liability and KO with Terapagos/Flareon, stealing the game away.
**Closing Thoughts**
	Overall, Eevee Box is a really fun deck, and I’ll definitely continue to use it in the future. While this deck can be quite good, it does admittedly suffer from some glaring issues. First off, if we don’t open Fan Rotom + Tera (even with all of our consistency cards), we’re in big trouble if the opponent capitalizes off of our slow start. Also, our deck hurts under item lock, which denies us Pidgeot and our ball searches (although we do have a fair bit of supporter search to compensate). More and more decks have started adding Team Rocket’s Watchtower to their deck, which completely shuts off both of our draw engines. If they manage to Iono + Watchtower late game and we’re not prepared, we’re really cooked. However, don’t let that stop you from giving this deck a try! Given all the lines I’ve talked about above and the complexity of the deck, Eevee Box can be one of the most satisfying and fulfilling decks to play and win with. It’s also fairly well-positioned after rotation; although Pidgeot rotates, we’ll have access to Mega Dragonite + Dragonair, but I’ll cover that when it comes to it.
